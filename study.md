### Big O

In other words:
• If your algorithm is in the form "do this, then, when you're all done, do that" then you add the runtimes.
• If your algorithm is in the form "do this for each time you do that" then you multiply the runtimes.
It's very easy to mess this up in an interview, so be careful.

- When you see a problem where the number of elements in the problem space gets halved each time, that will likely be a 0( l o g N) runtime.

NEED TO KNOW:

- how to use
- how to implement them from scratch
- know the space and time complexity

#### Data Structures

Linked Lists  
Trees, Tries, & Graphs  
Stacks & Queues  
Heaps
Vectors/ArrayLists
Hash Tables (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)

#### Algorithms

Breadth-First Search
Depth-First Search
Binary Search
Merge Sort
Quick Sort

#### Concepts

Bit Manipulation
Memory (Stack vs. Heap)
Recursion
Dynamic Programming
Big 0 Time & Space

## Hash Tables

- Hash tables are unordered associations between keys and values. Very similar to a JavaScript object.
- If we store elements at keys in hashmaps, the number of comparisons that we would need to do to find out the key would be constant O(1) and it would not depend on the bymber of elements stored in the hashmap.
